# The-London-Wayfarer

This is a simple one page brochure website, it uses vanilla html, css and javascript. It is intended to be a quick and easy portfolio piece demonstrating some of my design skills and that I have learned the basics of html, css and javascript DOM manipulation. 

At the time of writing (16/7/21) this project is in mid-development. I still need to refactor the code, make the site responsive and do general tweaks before it is complete. 

The site was created using my Figma design as a blueprint;

Updates;
19/07/21
Changed the Dorms, Facilities and Location section to CSS Grid so making the site responsive is easier and made alterations to the html and style.css doc to support this. Refactored my script.js file. Added a mobile hero image. Also added a queries.css file with all the media query data, site should now be fully responsive but am unable to test on physical devices as I don't currently have a web server.

Added portrait and landscape only media queries for the modal popups to help with responsiveness.
