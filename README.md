# The-London-Wayfarer

This is a simple one page brochure website, it uses vanilla html, css and javascript. It is intended to be a quick and easy portfolio piece demonstrating some of my design skills and that I have learned the basics of html, css and javascript DOM manipulation. 

At the time of writing (16/7/21) this project is in mid-development. I still need to refactor the code, make the site responsive and do general tweaks before it is complete. 

The site was created using this Figma design as a blueprint;
